dionaea, wordpot, cowrie, and conpot

Any issues you encountered  
I was not able to upload a payload onto my wordpot VM using metasploit due  
"exploit failed: The following options failed to validate: USERNAME, PASSWORD"  
  
A summary of the data collected: number of attacks, number of malware samples, etc.  
  
Any unresolved questions raised by the data collected  
1. Why was I unable to upload the metasploit payload?
2. Why were there so many attacks/attempts yet 0 payload?
  
Additionally, include a json export of the data you collected in the repo, instructions for which can be found in the next section.
